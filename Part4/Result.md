The results obtained by compiling and executing the codes for python and go reflects that each time it is executed we get different result because the incrementing and decrementing threads are running parallel with shared varibale i which results in different final value of i because of issues like deadlocks,race condition and scheduling.Whereas the results from c code is not changing its showing 0 always don't know the reason exactly but I think its running the first thread first then the second thread so finally the values cancel out and shows 0.
